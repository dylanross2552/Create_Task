# Create_Task
create task turn based game
This is the first time Alex and I are using Git, hopefully it is a lot more intuitive than visual studio team services.
Anyway, we both made 2 halves of a spin-off fire emblem like game within visual studio C# for our AP class.
This repository was created so we could take on the task of merging both halves a little easier.
